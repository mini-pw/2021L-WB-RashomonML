# PD4 Summary
The first goal was to reproduce machine learning models from article [Benchmarking deep learning models on large healthcare datasets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046418300716), however it proved to be much more difficult than expected. Despite making dozens of adjustments to the code supplied by the article's authors it appeared too hard to obtain required data from the MIMIC-III database and reproduce models from the article. Eventually another scientific paper was chosen. [Reproducibility in critical care: a mortality prediction case study](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v68/johnson17a.html) focused on reproducing results from other studies. It also needed a few changes in code. Some fragments in code were oudated and needed to be corrected to work properly. Overall this article was much easier to work with and we were able to reproduce the authors’ models with similar results.
